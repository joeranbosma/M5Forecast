# this is a basic neural network that:
# 0. loads a training dataset 
# 1. trains a neural network (model) on the dataset
# 1.1 The training consists of the following loop of: 1.1.1 to 1.1.3: 
# 1.1.1 setting weights in neurons in the network
# 1.1.2 predicting an output based on an input/datasample.
# 1.1.3 Performing backpropagation of the error to adjust the weights
# 2. loads a test set
# 3. Uses the trained model to perform a prediction/classification
